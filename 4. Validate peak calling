#Use genome browser to validate peak calling
##upload bigwig and bed files to IGV or UCSC

##below is instruction for uploading files to UCSC

###Bigwig

1. Make new directory at /scratch/webserver/siwase (replace siwase with your directory)
2. Move the bigwig files to webserver directory. /scratch/webserver/siwase/new_directory/new.bw
3. Go to UCSC browser, select the genome, My Data --> Custum track
4. track type=bigWig name="H3K4me1_0h_JF1_rep1" 
5. Past follwoing to the URL box (change parameters as needed, see instruction at UCSC browser)
bigDataUrl=https://hkgateway.med.umich.edu/public/iwaselab/new_directory/new.bw visibility=full color=0,64,255 autoScale=off alwaysZero=off gridDefault=off maxHeightPixels=60 graphType=bar viewLimits=0:5 windowingFunction=mean smoothingWindow=2 altColor=0,64,255


###Bed

1. Make new directory at /scratch/webserver/siwase (replace siwase with your directory)
2. Before moving narrowpeak files (MACS2 output BED format), add the following line on the top row of narrow peak file

track type=narrowPeak name=H3K4me3_48h_JF1_rep1

3. Move the bigwig files to webserver directory. /scratch/webserver/siwase/new_directory/new.narrowPeak
4. At the UCSC custom track URL box, paste following

https://hkgateway.med.umich.edu/public/iwaselab/new_directory/new.narrowPeak
